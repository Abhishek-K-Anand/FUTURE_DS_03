# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes UK road accident data (2021–2022) using **Power BI** and **Python** (Matplotlib & Seaborn).  
We explored how weather, lighting, road types, and vehicle types affect accident rates.  
The goal is to turn raw data into clear visuals to help reduce accidents and improve road safety.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify high-risk conditions (weather, lighting, time)
- Analyze accidents by vehicle type and location
- Study monthly accident trends
- Present insights using interactive dashboards
- Suggest data-driven safety improvements

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboards  
- **Python** – For data cleaning & analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visualizations  
- **Excel** – To manage and prepare raw data

## 📈 Key Insights & Visualizations

### 🚗 Casualties by Vehicle Type
- Cars caused nearly **80%** of accident casualties  
- Very few cases involved bicycles or buses  
➡️ **Focus area:** Car drivers need more safety awareness

---

### ☀️🌧️ Weather & Light Impact
- **73%** of accidents happened in **daylight**  
- **67%** occurred on **dry roads**  
➡️ **Insight:** Even good conditions need strict monitoring

---

### 📅 Monthly Trend
- **January–February** had the **highest** casualties  
- **October–November** had relatively fewer accidents  
➡️ **Plan:** Focus on early-year safety measures and awareness


---

### 🌆 Area-wise Casualties
- **61%** of casualties were in **urban areas**  
➡️ **Suggestion:** Improve traffic control in cities

---

### 🛣️ Road Type Analysis
- Most accidents occurred on **Single Carriageways**  
➡️ **Action:** Upgrade road design and lane markings

---

## 💡 Recommendations & Safety Improvements

1. **Target High-Risk Months**  
   Launch safety campaigns and stricter monitoring in **January and February**, as these months showed the **highest number of casualties**.

2. **Promote Safe Car Driving**  
   Conduct awareness drives and enforce rules for private vehicle owners.

3. **Enhance Urban Traffic Systems**  
   Improve signals, install CCTV, and create safer pedestrian zones.

4. **Fix Risky Roads**  
   Upgrade single carriageways with better markings and warning signs.

5. **Monitor Daytime Driving**  
   Encourage vigilance even during good daylight conditions.

---
**These actions, based on data insights, can help save lives and make roads safer for everyone.**
